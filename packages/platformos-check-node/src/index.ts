 * instance is what makes those memos pay off, and keeping the SDL string stable is
 * also what lets check-common's schema cache hit.
 *
 * Reuse is time-boxed rather than permanent, because those memos also pin whatever
 * each resource resolved to on first use — including the bundled fallback a loader
 * settles for when the cache directory is missing or a resource file is unreadable
 * (see `findSuitableResource`). The fallback is a complete docset, so the cost is
 * staleness rather than breakage: a process that started before its docs were
 * downloaded keeps linting against the bundled snapshot. Rebuilding on the first
 * run after {@link DOCS_MANAGER_MAX_AGE_MS} keeps a burst of `validate_code` calls
 * on one instance while letting a long-lived process pick up a new remote revision

 * files, and the buffer under edit is overlaid in memory so the UNSAVED content
 * is what gets linted and cross-referenced. Returns the structured
 * check-common `Offense[]` for the buffer's file, with `fix` / `suggest` and all

 *
 * `filePath` must be absolute. When it already exists in the project its
 * on-disk `SourceCode` is replaced by the buffer; when it is new (not yet
 * saved) the buffer is added so it is still linted.
 *
 * Only the buffer's file is VISITED (`CheckOptions.only`), while the complete
 * project is still handed to `check()` so cross-file checks resolve against it.
 * That is a pure speed-up, not a narrowing: offenses are always attributed to the
 * visited file, so visiting the others could only ever produce results this
 * function discards. On a 1400-file project it takes the check phase from ~21 s to
 * ~0.15 s — after which `getAppAndConfig` below, which reads and eagerly parses
 * every file in the project on every call, is what dominates the latency a caller
